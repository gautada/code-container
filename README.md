[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a lightweight but 
powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available 
for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for 
JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions 
for other languages and runtimes (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go, 
.NET).

[Visual Studio Code 
Server](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/vscode-server) is a 
service you can run on a remote development machine, like your desktop 
PC or a virtual machine (VM). It allows you to securely connect to that 
remote machine from anywhere through a local VS Code client, without 
the requirement of SSH.
